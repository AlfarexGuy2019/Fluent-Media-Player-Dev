## Insider Program & Contribution

**What benefits do I get from joining the Insider Program?**

First, the app early.

Insiders in the Bloom Channel get access to the earliest builds possible. This really gives you a chance to see what we are working on, and to give feedback as we actively work on parts of the app, meaning your feedback means a whole lot! Of course, it isn't without it's disadvantages. Bloom Channel insiders also face more bugs and issues than other users. Bloom Insiders also get access to features tagged 'Experimental', meaning we have put very little work into them at that point, or they are very unstable, but interesting to try out nonetheless. These features are never enabled by default.

Early Access Insiders (previously Seeding Insiders) get access to the app earlier, although with much more stability. Experimental features will not be available to Insiders in this channel.*

*Features tagged as Experimental in the Settings interface

Good luck testing!

**Hey, I'm an Insider. How do I get builds?**

When you've submitted your form. There's nothing else you need to do, just wait. When the next build is released, you will receive an email to our Insider Portal, where you can download the msix package for the new build. **Note: Alpha builds and up will use the Microsoft Store for distribution, but we have chosen to use MSIX for Pre-Alpha as there will be many builds** Some weeks, Insiders from both channels may receive the same builds. This is normal, don't worry!
