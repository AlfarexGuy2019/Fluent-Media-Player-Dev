**Fluent Media Player (Working Title)** is a media player, designed to align to the Windows 11 visual style, using **WinUI 2.6** and **C#**. We hope to create a media player that is not only beautiful, but incredibly functional; taking features from classic media players like **Windows Media Player** and bringing it to the modern world, with online services and more sharing features.

- **How does it look?**

> The app is in a very early stage. Please note that the current version of the app does not resemble the final product. We have made some renders of what we hope the final app looks like :): Of course we couldn't forget Mica, Acrylic and Dark Mode support!

> **Light Mode**

- **How to download it?**

> There isn't any direct method to install it, so you need to fire up the project in Visual Studio, open the solution and then deploy it onto your Device. We wouldn't suggest downloading at this point, as it is simply not functional enough. If you want to know more, join our Discord! 

- **I think maybe I can help in development too. How can I help?**

> If you have deployed the app onto your device and tested it, you can provide feedback in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/GQRYrrBMqd). Or if you think you can help with development, just start clone the repository, do some work, and make PRs. If we see that you're doing some real cool work, we'll add you as a collaborator.

- **What do I need to to do if I am willing to help in the development?**

> We've been working on it, and since you want to help, we could do with help in the following tasks:

- [x] Make the main project file
- [ ] Make the backend of the app.
- [ ] Implement full use of WinUI 2.6 in the UX.
- [ ] Use AI to implement an automated system throughout the app.
- [ ] Decide a proper name for the app since all that stuff goes into the UI.
- [x] Make a Deployable solution.
- [ ] Publish it on the Microsoft Store.
